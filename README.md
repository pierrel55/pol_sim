# pol_sim
This program presents a local realistic method to simulate a polarizer.

It is then used to simulate an EPR-type experiment.

A graphical interface allows to define various simulation parameters and compare the results with those provided by the QM.

The interface is used to display characteristic curves (coincidences, transmittance), and to perform Bell inequality type tests.

This allows to evaluate what can be achieved with a local model.

The program works under X11 (tested on linux only) or windows (seven to 10).
The code can be compiled with GCC linux, mingw, visual studio.
The linux version works natively under X11 and does not require additional installations.
