Note: January 8, 2022

This program is an old version of the local method used to simulate the polarizer.
The new method is described in these two documents.
https://vixra.org/abs/2201.0019
https://vixra.org/abs/2201.0032

I left the program here because it give results close to the new method used.
I will maybe update it in the future.
